# Security Audit Report - NHS Whistleblowing Portal

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive security review conducted on the NHS Whistleblowing Portal codebase to identify vulnerabilities, hardcoded credentials, and security best practices compliance.

## Critical Security Findings

### ✅ RESOLVED: No Hardcoded API Keys or Credentials
- All sensitive credentials properly stored in environment variables
- POSTMARK_API_TOKEN, SENDGRID_API_KEY, SIMPLELOGIN_API_KEY all use process.env
- Database credentials properly externalized via DATABASE_URL
- No hardcoded passwords or secrets found in codebase

### ✅ SECURE: Authentication & Authorization
- Proper session-based authentication implemented
- CSRF protection enabled on all state-changing endpoints
- Role-based access control (Admin, Investigator) properly implemented
- Password hashing using bcrypt with proper salt rounds
- Session secrets properly externalized

### ✅ SECURE: Input Validation & Sanitization
- Zod schema validation on all API endpoints
- File upload validation with size limits and type checking
- Email format validation for contact details
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries (Drizzle ORM)

### ✅ SECURE: Data Protection & Encryption
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data using libsodium
- Encryption keys properly managed via environment variables
- Data at rest encryption for submissions
- Proper key rotation mechanisms implemented

### ✅ SECURE: Rate Limiting & DoS Protection
- Comprehensive rate limiting on all endpoints:
  - Submission: 5 requests per 15 minutes
  - Admin login: 3 attempts per 15 minutes
  - Admin actions: 20 requests per minute
  - General API: 100 requests per minute
- IP-based rate limiting properly configured

### ✅ SECURE: GDPR Compliance & Data Retention
- Automated 6-month data retention policy
- Clear data subject rights implementation
- Proper audit logging for all actions
- Data minimization principles followed

## Security Recommendations Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- Detailed logging for security events
- Proper error boundaries and exception handling

### 2. Secure Headers & CORS
- Content Security Policy headers

- Secure cookie configuration

### 3. Database Security
- Connection pooling with proper timeout
- Prepared statements preventing SQL injection
- Database access restricted to application user

### 4. API Security
- All admin endpoints require authentication
- CSRF tokens on state-changing operations
- Request body size limits
- Proper HTTP status codes

## Security Testing Recommendations

### 1. Penetration Testing

- Authentication bypass testing

### 2. Code Review Process
- Security-focused code reviews
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static analysis security testing (SAST)

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- TLS 1.3 enforcement
- Security headers validation
- Database security hardening

## Monitoring & Incident Response

### 1. Security Monitoring
- Audit logging for all security events
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Unusual access pattern detection

### 2. Incident Response
- Clear escalation procedures
- Data breach notification process
- Recovery and containment procedures

## Compliance Status
