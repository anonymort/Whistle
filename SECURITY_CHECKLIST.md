- [ ] Set secure session secrets
- [ ] Configure HTTPS/TLS certificates
- [ ] Enable security headers
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up database encryption at rest

### Monitoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Set up error monitoring
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Implement health checks
- [ ] Schedule regular security updates
- [ ] Plan key rotation schedule
- [ ] Test backup and recovery procedures

### Compliance Verification
- [ ] GDPR compliance review
- [ ] Data retention policy validation

- [x] File signature validation tested
- [x] Input validation tested
- [x] Error handling tested
- [ ] **RECOMMENDED**: OWASP security scan
- [ ] **RECOMMENDED**: Third-party security audit

## Operational Security

### Admin Procedures
- [ ] Secure key storage implementation
- [ ] Admin access logging
- [ ] Regular key rotation schedule
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Data breach notification process

### User Communication
- [x] Clear privacy policy
- [x] Security feature explanation

- [x] Contact information provided
- [ ] User security guidelines

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **Admin Compromise**: Single admin account - implement MFA
- **Key Loss**: Keys stored in memory - implement secure backup
- **File Malware**: Basic validation only - add antivirus scanning

### Medium Priority Risks
- **Rate Limiting Bypass**: IP-based only - consider user fingerprinting
- **Session Hijacking**: Standard sessions - implement additional validation
- **Data Exfiltration**: Admin can decrypt all - implement access logging

### Low Priority Risks
- **Metadata Leakage**: Basic stripping - consider deeper analysis
- **Timing Attacks**: Standard operations - implement constant-time operations
- **Side Channel**: Standard crypto - consider hardware security modules

## ICO/NHS Compliance Notes

### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
