- **Rate Limiting:** Comprehensive limits on all critical endpoints

### 📊 **Audit & Compliance**
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging:** All admin actions tracked
- **GDPR Compliance:** 6-month data retention with automated cleanup
- **Data Minimisation:** Encrypted storage of sensitive fields
- **Right to Erasure:** Manual deletion capabilities

### 🌐 **Network Security**
- **Security Headers:** CSP, XSS protection, HSTS
- **Input Validation:** Zod schemas for all endpoints
- **SQL Injection Protection:** Drizzle ORM with parameterised queries

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues FIXED

### 1. **FIXED: Private Key Exposure Risk** ⚠️ → ✅
**Issue:** API endpoint exposed encryption private keys  
**Fix Applied:** Completely disabled endpoint, added security audit logging  
**Impact:** Eliminates risk of key compromise via API

### 2. **FIXED: CSP Nonce Generation** ⚠️ → ✅
**Issue:** Content Security Policy referenced undefined nonce  
**Fix Applied:** Added proper nonce generation middleware  
**Impact:** Prevents XSS attacks, strengthens CSP

### 3. **FIXED: Session Security** ⚠️ → ✅
**Issue:** 30-minute session timeout too long for high-security app  
**Fix Applied:** Reduced to 15 minutes, added rolling sessions  
**Impact:** Reduces session hijacking window

### 4. **FIXED: File Upload Security** ⚠️ → ✅
**Issue:** Insufficient file validation, path traversal risk  
**Fix Applied:** Enhanced filename sanitisation, suspicious pattern detection  
**Impact:** Prevents malicious file uploads and path traversal

### 5. **FIXED: Encryption Algorithm Validation** ⚠️ → ✅
**Issue:** Legacy insecure encryption algorithms still accepted  
**Fix Applied:** Only allow libsodium-sealed-box algorithm  
**Impact:** Ensures only secure encryption methods used

## 🔍 Security Architecture Analysis

### **Client-Side Security (React)**
```typescript
// ✅ Proper client-side encryption flow
1. Fetch admin public key from server
2. Encrypt all sensitive data using libsodium
3. Send encrypted JSON via HTTPS
4. No plaintext sensitive data in transit
```

### **Server-Side Security (Express)**
```typescript
// ✅ Secure server-side decryption
1. Validate encrypted data structure
2. Decrypt using admin private key
3. Verify data integrity with checksums
4. Audit all decryption operations
```

### **Database Security (PostgreSQL + Drizzle)**
```sql
-- ✅ All sensitive fields encrypted at rest
submissions.encrypted_message        -- End-to-end encrypted
submissions.encrypted_contact_details -- End-to-end encrypted  
submissions.encrypted_file           -- End-to-end encrypted
submissions.encrypted_reporter_name  -- End-to-end encrypted
```

## 🎯 GDPR Compliance Assessment

### **Article 5 (Data Minimisation)** ✅
- Only collect necessary data for whistleblowing reports
- Automated 6-month retention policy
- Encrypted storage of all personal data

### **Article 25 (Data Protection by Design)** ✅  
- End-to-end encryption prevents unauthorised access
- Pseudonymisation through encrypted storage
- Security-first architecture

### **Article 32 (Security of Processing)** ✅
- State-of-the-art encryption (libsodium)
- Regular key rotation capabilities
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Access controls and authentication

### **Article 17 (Right to Erasure)** ✅
- Manual deletion capabilities for admins
- Automated retention policy cleanup
- Secure deletion of associated files

## 🔧 Additional Security Recommendations

### **1. Environment Security**
```bash
# Set these environment variables for production:
ADMIN_ENCRYPTION_PUBLIC_KEY=<base64_public_key>
ADMIN_ENCRYPTION_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64_private_key>
ADMIN_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY=<base64_signing_public_key>  
ADMIN_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY=<base64_signing_private_key>
SESSION_SECRET=<strong_random_string>
DATABASE_URL=<postgresql_connection_with_ssl>
```

### **2. Key Management Best Practices**
- 🔄 **Rotate keys quarterly** using the admin interface
- 🔐 **Store keys in secure key management system** (not environment variables) for production
- 📋 **Backup keys securely** with offline storage
- 🕰️ **Implement key versioning** for smooth rotation

### **3. Monitoring & Alerting**
- 📊 **Monitor audit logs** for suspicious activity
- 🚨 **Alert on multiple failed login attempts**
- 📈 **Track encryption/decryption failure rates**
- 🔍 **Monitor file upload patterns**

### **4. Deployment Security**
```bash
# For production deployment:
- Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- Configure database SSL connections
- Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Implement DDoS protection
- Regular security updates for dependencies
```
