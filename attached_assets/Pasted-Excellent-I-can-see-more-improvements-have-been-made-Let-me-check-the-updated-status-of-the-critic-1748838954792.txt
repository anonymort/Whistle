Excellent! I can see more improvements have been made. Let me check the updated status of the critical issues:

## Updated Security Assessment - Significant Improvements! ✅

Based on my review, I can confirm that **MAJOR SECURITY FIXES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED**:

### ✅ Fixed Critical Issues:

1. **Hardcoded Credentials** - FIXED ✅
   - Now uses environment variables: `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - Validates required environment variables on startup

2. **Encryption Keys in Memory** - FIXED ✅
   ```typescript
   // Keys now loaded from environment variables first
   if (process.env.ADMIN_ENCRYPTION_PUBLIC_KEY && process.env.ADMIN_ENCRYPTION_PRIVATE_KEY) {
     adminEncryptionKeys = {
       publicKey: process.env.ADMIN_ENCRYPTION_PUBLIC_KEY,
       privateKey: process.env.ADMIN_ENCRYPTION_PRIVATE_KEY
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Password Hashing** - PARTIALLY FIXED ⚠️
   ```typescript
   // Password hashing function exists
   function hashPassword(password: string): string {
     return crypto.pbkdf2Sync(password, process.env.SESSION_SECRET || 'fallback-salt', 100000, 64, 'sha512').toString('hex');
   }
   ```
   **Issue**: The function is defined but I couldn't find where it's actually used in authentication!

4. **Security Headers** - FIXED ✅
   - Comprehensive security headers added for production
   - Content Security Policy implemented
   - X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.

5. **Environment Variable Validation** - FIXED ✅
   - Application exits if required variables are missing
   - Clear error messages for missing configuration

### ⚠️ Remaining Issues:

1. **Password Hashing Not Applied**
   - The `hashPassword` function exists but appears unused
   - Passwords still compared in plain text in `routes.ts`

2. **No .env.example File**
   - Documentation exists in `SECURITY_FIXES.md` but no `.env.example` template

3. **File Metadata Stripping Still Incomplete**
   - Only handles images, other files pass through unchanged

4. **Missing File Signature Validation Usage**
   - `validateFileSignature` function defined but never called

### Quick Fix for Password Hashing:

The password hashing needs to be integrated into the authentication flow:

```typescript
// In server/routes.ts, update the login endpoint:
import { hashPassword } from '../index';

// When verifying credentials:
const hashedInputPassword = hashPassword(password);
const hashedAdminPassword = hashPassword(adminPassword);

if (username === adminUsername && hashedInputPassword === hashedAdminPassword) {
  // Authenticate
}
```

### Summary:

The application has made **significant security improvements**:
- ✅ No more hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Encryption keys can be persisted via environment
- ✅ Security headers implemented
- ✅ Environment validation on startup

However, the password hashing implementation is incomplete - the function exists but isn't being used in the authentication process. This is the main remaining security concern that needs immediate attention.

The improvements show excellent progress towards production readiness! Just need to complete the password hashing integration and you'll have addressed all the critical security vulnerabilities.
