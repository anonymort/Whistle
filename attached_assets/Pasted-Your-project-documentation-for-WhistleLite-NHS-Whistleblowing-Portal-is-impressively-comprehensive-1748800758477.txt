Your project documentation for WhistleLite – NHS Whistleblowing Portal is impressively comprehensive and well-organised. Here’s a structured review across key domains:

⸻

✅ Overall Strengths

🔐 Security & Privacy
	•	End-to-end encryption using libsodium (sealed box) is a strong choice for whistleblowing use cases.
	•	GDPR compliance is thoughtfully baked in, including:
	•	90-day data retention
	•	Anonymous submissions
	•	Metadata stripping
	•	Use of rate limiting and session-based authentication for the admin portal improves security posture.

💻 Technical Stack
	•	Clean, modern stack:
	•	React + TypeScript + Vite frontend
	•	Express + PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM backend
	•	Tailwind + shadcn/ui for design consistency and responsiveness
	•	Good separation of concerns (client/server/shared directories).
	•	Use of libsodium-wrappers on both frontend and backend ensures consistent encryption logic.

🧱 Structure & Documentation
	•	Directory layout is clearly documented and intuitive.
	•	Installation instructions are minimal and clear.
	•	Security configuration section is detailed and appropriate.
	•	Use of hooks and modular component layout (hooks/use-toast, components/ui, etc.) indicates scalability.

⚠️ Recommendations & Weak Spots

🔧 Backend Concerns
	•	Password authentication only may be insufficient for an admin portal managing sensitive content. Consider MFA (even time-based OTP via email) or Yubikey support.
	•	File uploads handled on backend: it’s not clear if antivirus scanning or MIME-type checking is enforced.
	•	No mention of CSP headers or HTTPS requirements for deployment. For whistleblowing, security headers should be enforced (CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.).

📂 GDPR Compliance Risks
	•	You mention 90-day data retention, but it’s unclear:
	•	How this is enforced programmatically
	•	Whether reporters can request erasure of submissions
	•	File metadata stripping is referenced, but exact tools or methods (e.g. ExifTool, in-browser library) aren’t detailed.

🧪 Testing & Deployment
	•	There’s no mention of:
	•	Unit or integration tests
	•	Deployment strategy (e.g. Netlify for frontend + Fly.io/Vercel for backend? Docker? CI/CD?)
	•	Monitoring/logging (which may raise GDPR implications)
	•	Suggest adding a minimal test suite using Vitest or Jest.

🔄 Admin Portal UX
	•	Suggest clarifying:
	•	Whether the admin dashboard can respond to submissions anonymously
	•	If multiple admins can be configured
	•	How encrypted messages are decrypted (client-side with key input? pre-shared admin key?)

✅ Quick Wins

Area	Suggestion
⚙️ Config	Add .env.example to repo with safe variable templates
🔐 Security	Add MFA or at least 2FA support for the admin dashboard
📤 Uploads	Explicitly sanitise file names + validate types before save
🧾 Legal	Consider a privacy.md with plain-English GDPR commitments
🧪 Testing	Create a /tests directory and stub out at least encryption and form submission logic
📦 Distribution	Consider Dockerising for rapid deployment/testability

If you’d like, I can help you:
	•	Write a privacy policy or terms of service for deployment
	•	Build the .env.example and deployment workflow
	•	Draft the file redaction and metadata-stripping logic
