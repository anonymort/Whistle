To use Postmark to handle anonymous email aliases with reply support for your Whistle portal (e.g. random123@dauk.org → real inbox ↔️ anonymous reply), you’ll need to build a lightweight alias routing system using Postmark’s Inbound API, Outbound API, and a database mapping layer.

🧠 Overview of Postmark Integration Strategy

Step	Action	Purpose
1	Set up Inbound processing with a catch-all (*@dauk.org)	Receive emails to any alias
2	Build alias mapping database (alias -> user email)	Identify recipient
3	Auto-generate aliases via your app	Ensure anonymity
4	Handle inbound messages via Postmark Webhook	Extract alias, forward to mapped real email
5	Enable anonymous replies via your domain	Mask sender identity
6	Send outbound replies via Postmark API with correct headers	Maintain alias on outbound path

🔧 Step-by-Step Guide

🔹 1. Set Up Postmark Inbound Domain (e.g. dauk.org)
	•	Add dauk.org as a Custom Inbound Domain in Postmark.
	•	Update DNS with:
	•	MX record pointing to inbound.postmarkapp.com
	•	SPF and DKIM (for trusted deliverability)
	•	Enable Inbound Webhook pointing to your server (e.g. https://whistle.dauk.org/api/inbound)

Postmark will now send structured JSON payloads for every inbound email to any *@dauk.org.

🔹 2. Create Alias Mapping Table

A basic table schema (SQL or NoSQL) for mapping:

alias (string)	user_email (string)	created_at
anon123@dauk.org	reporter@example.com	2025-06-04T...

You create a new alias each time a user ticks “anonymous reply” on Whistle. This can be a UUID or random string, e.g. slf92fh@dauk.org.

🔹 3. Handle Incoming Email via Webhook

When someone sends a reply to anon123@dauk.org, Postmark POSTs JSON to your inbound webhook like this:

{
  "From": "person@example.com",
  "To": "anon123@dauk.org",
  "Subject": "RE: Your submission",
  "TextBody": "Thanks for your report...",
  "HtmlBody": "...",
  ...
}

✅ Your handler should:
	•	Extract To (alias) → lookup real email in DB
	•	Parse & sanitise the body
	•	Send email to the real address (see next step)

⸻

🔹 4. Send Anonymous Reply via Postmark Outbound API

Make a POST to:

https://api.postmarkapp.com/email

With headers:

X-Postmark-Server-Token: YOUR_API_TOKEN

And body:

{
  "From": "anon123@dauk.org",
  "To": "reporter@example.com",
  "Subject": "RE: Your submission",
  "TextBody": "Thanks for your report...",
  "ReplyTo": "anon123@dauk.org",
  "MessageStream": "outbound"
}

💡 You are spoofing the alias as sender, so the recipient replies to the same address, keeping the loop intact.

⸻

🔒 5. Security & Governance
	•	Strip sensitive metadata from inbound JSON (headers, IPs, etc.)
	•	Limit reply forwarding to aliases created in past X days
	•	Rate-limit to prevent spam loops
	•	Store expiry for aliases (e.g. 30 days)

⸻

✅ Pros
	•	Super-fast delivery (<1s typical)
	•	Fully GDPR compliant (your backend handles PII)
	•	Infinite aliases — no count limits
	•	Fully programmable and auditable

⸻

🧰 Optional Enhancements
	•	Add encryption-at-rest for alias database
	•	Allow users to delete or rotate aliases
	•	Build UI for reviewing anonymous conversations

I can provide:
	•	A Node.js/Express or Python/Flask webhook receiver
	•	Sample alias generator and DB schema
	•	Postmark API helper to send replies
